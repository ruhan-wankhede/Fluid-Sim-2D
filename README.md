# ðŸ’§ 2D Fluid Simulation in Python

This project is a real-time 2D fluid simulation implemented in **Python** using **NumPy** and **Pygame**. It simulates fluid behavior such as smoke or dye using a grid-based velocity and density field.

## ðŸ“˜ Reference

This simulation is based on the semi-Lagrangian method described in the paper:
